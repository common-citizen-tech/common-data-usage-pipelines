# Common Data Usage Pipelines

## About

Common Data Usage is a tool for graph analysis of Open Government Data Usage in open-source projects.

Common Data Usage tool is currently in a proof-of-concept stage. Major changes without previous notice are expected.
Please, report any issues or suggestions.

This tool is built as a research effort to understand how open government data (OGD) is used in open-source projects. Preliminary analysis is focused on data.gov, the open data portal of the US government.

Code and docs will be uploaded soon.
